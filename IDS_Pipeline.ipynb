# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with TensorFlow TensorFlow version: 2.20.0

This notebook implements a modular IDS pipeline inspired by the KGMS-IDS framework (Electronics 2023). It includes:
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Autoencoder for feature reduction
- Dense Neural Network for classification
- SHAP for explainability

The goal is to detect rare-class network attacks with high accuracy and interpretability.

# cybersecurity-attack-classifier
Modular intrusion detection system (IDS) inspired by the KGMS-IDS framework (Electronics 2023). Integrates SMOTE for class balancing, autoencoder-based feature reduction, and dense neural network classification. Includes SHAP explainability for transparent attack prediction across multiple network threat types.

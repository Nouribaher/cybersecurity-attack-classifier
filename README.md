# Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project implements a modular, explainable intrusion detection system inspired by the hybrid deep learning framework proposed in [Electronics 2023, 12(9), 3911](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/9/3911). It combines preprocessing, imbalance handling, feature reduction, and classification to detect and explain network attacks using the KDD dataset.

## üîê Motivation
As a cybersecurity analyst, I designed this pipeline to:
- Detect diverse attack types with high accuracy
- Handle imbalanced datasets using synthetic oversampling
- Reduce feature dimensionality for faster inference
- Provide transparent model explanations using SHAP

## üß± Architecture
The pipeline consists of five modular components:

1. **Preprocessor**: Cleans and encodes raw network traffic
2. **Balancer**: Applies 'SMOTE', 'KGSOMTE', OR 'HYBRID' to balance attack classes
3. **Reducer**: Uses an autoencoder (or MDSAE) for feature compression
4. **Classifier**: Trains a dense neural network (or SVEDM) for attack prediction
5. **Evaluator**: Generates SHAP plots, confusion matrix, and Excel reports

 ### Why Encodingand  and Normalization  Matter  for IDS Pipeline
     - Without encoding, SMOTE treats categorical values like continuous numbers, which leads to invalid synthetic samples
     - Without normalization, features like src_bytes or duration dominate the interpolation, skewing the oversampling.
    So before applying SMOTE or KGSMOTE, all categorical features are encoded and the dataset is normalized. This ensures that synthetic samples are generated accurately in a fully numerical feature space.

###  What SMOTE Requires:
    - Numerical features only ‚Äî SMOTE uses distance-based interpolation, so categorical features must be encoded
    - Consistent scaling ‚Äî normalization (e.g., MinMaxScaler) helps ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations

### Results
    - Accuracy: 98.2% on test set
    - SHAP analysis reveals `same_srv_rate`, `dst_host_srv_count`, and `protocol_type` as top predictors
     - Misclassifications mostly occur between similar attack types (e.g., Probe vs DoS)

### What Is SMOTE?
SMOTE stands for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique. It‚Äôs a method used to address class imbalance in datasets, particularly when some attack types (like rare attacks : U2R (user to root) or R2L (remote to local) ) are underrepresented compared to normal traffic or DoS attacks.
Instead of duplicating rare samples, SMOTE generates synthetic examples by interpolating between existing minority class instances. This helps the model learn better decision boundaries.

###  Why SMOTE Matters in IDS Project?
- Improves detection of rare attacks that would otherwise be ignored by the model.
- Provides a fast and effective way to balance the dataset, reducing bias toward majority classes like normal or DoS traffic.
- Aligns with KGMS-IDS, which uses KGSMOTE (a KDE-enhanced variant) for rare-class oversampling

###  Why KGSMOTE Matters in IDS Project?
- Refines this approach by using kernel density estimation (KDE)  to understand where real samples are densely clustered  and then generates synthetic samples within those dense regions, avoiding outliers.
-  Instead of interpolating randomly (like SMOTE), KGSMOTE samples from the KDE model, which acts like a map of where realistic data lives. This makes synthetic samples more natural and representative of the minority class.
 - Ensures that new  synthetic samples match those Rare attacks like U2R and R2L have complex feature patterns, rather than distorting them, reducing noise and improving model precision.

###  Why SMOTE and KGSMOTE Matter in This Project 
In cybersecurity intrusion detection, data imbalance is a critical challenge. Attack types like U2R and R2L are severely underrepresented, making it difficult for machine learning models to learn their patterns. 
To address this, the project integrates two complementary oversampling techniques.
By applying SMOTE for broad coverage and KGSMOTE for targeted realism, the IDS pipeline achieves a balanced, explainable, and academically grounded dataset. This dual strategy enhances model performance, supports SHAP-based interpretability, and aligns with best practices in cybersecurity research.
 In fact, combining them strategically can give IDS pipeline a serious edge in both performance,aligns with academic standards, and academic credibility.

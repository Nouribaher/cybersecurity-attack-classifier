# Cybersecurity-Attack-Classifier
Modular intrusion detection system (IDS) inspired by the KGMS-IDS framework (Electronics 2023). Integrates SMOTE for class balancing, autoencoder-based feature reduction, and dense neural network classification. Includes SHAP explainability for transparent attack prediction across multiple network threat types.
# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with TensorFlow 
This  Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) implements a modular IDS pipeline. It includes:
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Autoencoder for feature reduction
- Dense Neural Network for classification
- SHAP for explainability

The goal is to detect rare-class network attacks with high accuracy and interpretability.
